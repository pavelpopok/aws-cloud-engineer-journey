### Week 3: VPC Design & Infrastructure as Code
**Skills Gained**
- Custom VPC architecture
- Public/private subnet design
- NAT Gateway configuration
- Bastion host pattern
- AWS CLI automation
- Terraform fundamentals

**Key Concepts**
- CIDR planning
- Route tables
- Internet Gateway vs NAT Gateway
- Infrastructure as Code (declarative vs imperative)
- Security in depth

**Projects:**
- Production-grade VPC (multi-AZ, defense-in-depth)
- Bastion host for secure access
- VPC rebuild in Terraform
- Cleanup automation scripts

**Struggles**
- VPC deletion dependencies
- Bash script limitations vs Terraform
- Understanding NAT Gateway placement

**Key Insight:**
Terraform is dramatically faster and more reliable than manual or bash approaches for infrastructure.
