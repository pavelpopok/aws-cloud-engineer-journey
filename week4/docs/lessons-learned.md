# Week 4 Lessons

- Platform compatibility: Apple Silicon ≠ AWS (use --platform linux/amd64)
- Fargate networking: Public IP required in public subnet
- Health checks: Need specific endpoint returning 200
- Cost awareness: Stop resources when done
- Persistence: 17 issues, never quit

Hardest week yet. Most valuable.
